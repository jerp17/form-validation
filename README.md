# form-validation
form validation using javascript
Created a registration form with inputs like name, email, password, confirm password, and submit button.
Disabled HTML default validation to fully control validation behavior using JavaScript.
Added JavaScript functions to validate each input field individually using conditions and regular expressions.
Displayed meaningful error messages below each input field dynamically instead of using alert boxes.
Prevented form submission using event.preventDefault() until all validations pass.
Added real-time validation using keyup or blur events to improve user experience.
Styled error and success states using CSS classes toggled through JavaScript.
Tested edge cases like empty inputs, invalid email formats, and weak passwords thoroughly.
